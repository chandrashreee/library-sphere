## System Architecture

### Database Design

Library Sphere uses MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, with Prisma ORM to provide a flexible but structured data model. The database design follows a document-oriented approach while maintaining relational aspects through references.

#### Database Architecture

The database architecture is designed to support the core functionality of a library management system with the following key entities:

1. **Member**
   - Represents library patrons who can borrow documents
   - Contains personal information, contact details, and authentication credentials
   - Linked to loans and reservations

2. **Employee**
   - Represents library staff with different permission levels
   - Contains personal information, contact details, and authentication credentials
   - Includes role information (employee or admin)

3. **Document**
   - Represents library materials (books, comics, games, films)
   - Contains metadata such as title, author, year, and classification
   - Linked to loans and reservations

4. **Loan**
   - Represents the borrowing transaction of a document by a member
   - Contains loan dates, return information, and status
   - Links members and documents

5. **Reservation**
   - Represents requests for currently unavailable documents
   - Contains reservation dates, expiry date, and status
   - Links members and documents

6. **NextAuth Tables**
   - Supports authentication via NextAuth.js
   - Includes Account, Session, and VerificationToken collections

#### Entity Relationships

The relationships between entities are maintained through document references:

```
Member
  │
  ├── Loans (one-to-many) ──┐
  │                         │
  └── Reservations (one-to-many) ┐
                           │     │
Document                   │     │
  │                        │     │
  ├── Loans (one-to-many) ─┘     │
  │                              │
  └── Reservations (one-to-many) ┘
```

#### Data Model Design Principles

1. **Normalization Balance**
   - Data is normalized to reduce redundancy while maintaining performance
   - Some denormalization for frequently accessed data patterns

2. **Referential Integrity**
   - Foreign key relationships are maintained through Prisma's relation fields
   - Document references ensure data consistency

3. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields to improve performance
   - Compound indexes for common query patterns

4. **Data Validation**
   - Schema-level validation through Prisma schema
   - Additional application-level validation for complex business rules

5. **Unique Constraints**
   - Unique indexes to prevent duplicate entries
   - Compound uniqueness constraints for business rules (e.g., one active loan per document)

### API Routes

Library Sphere uses Next.js API routes to provide a RESTful API for client-server communication. These API routes handle data fetching, authentication, and business logic operations.

#### API Architecture

The API follows REST principles and is organized around the core resources of the application:

1. **Authentication**
   - `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`: Authentication endpoints powered by NextAuth.js
   - Handles login, session management, and token validation

2. **Documents**
   - `/api/documents`: Manages the library collection
   - Supports CRUD operations for documents
   - Includes filtering and search capabilities

3. **Loans**
   - `/api/loans`: Manages document borrowing
   - Handles creating, updating, and retrieving loans
   - Enforces business rules like availability checks

4. **Reservations**
   - `/api/reservations`: Manages document reservation requests
   - Handles creating, fulfilling, and cancelling reservations
   - Enforces reservation rules and priorities

5. **Members**
   - `/api/members`: Manages library patrons
   - Handles member registration and profile management
   - Provides access to member-specific information

6. **Employees**
   - `/api/employees`: Manages library staff
   - Supports employee account management
   - Enforces role-based access controls

#### API Design Principles

1. **RESTful Resource Modeling**
   - Resources match database entities
   - HTTP methods align with CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Consistent URL structure for predictability

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication via NextAuth.js
   - Role-based access control for protected endpoints
   - Session validation for secure operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Descriptive error messages for debugging

4. **Transaction Management**
   - Prisma transactions for multi-step operations
   - Rollback capabilities to ensure data integrity
   - Concurrency handling for race conditions

5. **API Response Structure**

   Successful responses follow a consistent format:
   ```json
   {
     "data": { /* response data */ },
     "message": "Operation successful"
   }
   ```

   Error responses follow this format:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Error message",
     "status": 400
   }
   ```

#### API Route Implementation

API routes are implemented as serverless functions that run on-demand:

1. **Request Validation**
   - Input validation for all requests
   - Type checking and data sanitization
   - Required field validation

2. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Session validation via NextAuth
   - Role permission checks
   - Route protection based on user type

3. **Database Operations**
   - Prisma client for database interactions
   - Optimized queries with proper selections
   - Transaction support for atomic operations

4. **Response Formatting**
   - Consistent JSON structure
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - CORS headers for cross-origin requests

### Authentication

Library Sphere implements a comprehensive authentication system using NextAuth.js to secure the application and manage user sessions. The authentication system supports different user roles with varying permissions and access levels.

#### Authentication Architecture

The authentication system follows a token-based approach with the following components:

1. **NextAuth.js Integration**
   - Central authentication provider for the application
   - Handles session management and token generation
   - Provides API routes for authentication operations

2. **Credentials Provider**
   - Email and password authentication
   - Role-based login flow (member vs. staff)
   - Password validation and security measures

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) based sessions
   - Secure cookie storage for session information
   - Server-side session validation

4. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - Three distinct roles: Member, Employee, and Admin
   - Role-specific access controls
   - Permission-based feature availability

#### Authentication Flow

The authentication process follows this sequence:

1. **Login Request**
   - User submits credentials (email, password, and role)
   - Credentials are sent to the NextAuth API endpoint

2. **Credential Verification**
   - System checks credentials against the appropriate collection (Member or Employee)
   - Password is verified using bcrypt comparison
   - Role is validated to ensure the user exists in the correct collection

3. **Session Creation**
   - Upon successful verification, NextAuth generates a JWT
   - User information and role are encoded in the token
   - Session is established with appropriate expiration time

4. **Session Persistence**
   - Session token is stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie
   - Token is refreshed automatically when needed
   - Session information is available to API routes for authorization

5. **Authorization Checks**
   - Protected routes verify the user's session and role
   - API endpoints validate permissions before processing requests
   - UI components conditionally render based on user role

#### Security Measures

The authentication system implements several security best practices:

1. **Password Security**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
   - No plaintext passwords are stored in the database
   - Strong password policies are enforced

2. **Token Security**
   - JWTs are signed with a secure secret
   - Tokens have appropriate expiration times
   - HTTP-only cookies prevent client-side token access

3. **CSRF Protection**
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery protection via NextAuth
   - Token validation on state-changing operations
   - Secure cookie configuration

4. **Session Validation**
   - Server-side validation of all session tokens
   - Expired sessions are automatically invalidated
   - Invalid sessions redirect to the login page

5. **Role Separation**
   - Strict separation between member and staff access
   - Clear boundaries between employee and admin capabilities
   - UI and API-level enforcement of role permissions

### Client-Side Pages

Library Sphere follows the Next.js App Router architecture to create a responsive, performant user interface. This section describes the client-side page structure, routing system, and component architecture.

#### Page Architecture

The application uses a modular page structure organized by feature:

1. **Public Pages**
   - `/login`: Authentication page for all users
   - `/catalog`: Document browsing interface (accessible to all users)

2. **Member Pages**
   - `/account`: Member profile and personal information
   - `/loans`: View and manage loans
   - `/reservations`: View and manage reservations

3. **Staff Pages**
   - `/members`: Manage library members
   - `/employees`: Manage staff accounts (admin only)
   - `/documents`: Manage the document collection

#### Routing System

The routing system is built on Next.js App Router, which provides:

1. **File-Based Routing**
   - Pages defined by file structure in the `app` directory
   - Dynamic routes using folder naming conventions
